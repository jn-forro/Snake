# Snake
This Snake game has been created as a final programming project of the CS-classes. It has been coded in **Delphi**, i.e. it works on Windows.
To play the game you simply have to download the file _Project1.exe_. Of course you can rename it afterwards.
Your data/highscores will be stored in the file _Snake.snk_, which will be created after you start the .exe. Do not delete that file if you want to sweat for highscores.

I do not own the used graphics. The owner of it is Mojang and some other people whose graphics I've easily found on Google.
